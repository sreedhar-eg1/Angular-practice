@if (number$ | async) {
<p>
  Child component runs on every count changes (On Push Strategy) {{ count() }}
</p>
<p>
    Now it only detect changes when the data from parent component changes or on
    any event occurs(Ex: click event) or with the help of async pipe(observable)
  </p>
  <p>if we use signal then there is no need of using change detection strategy</p>
