<p>
  Returns a new Observable that multicasts (shares) the original Observable. As
  long as there is at least one Subscriber this Observable will be subscribed
  and emitting data. When all subscribers have unsubscribed it will unsubscribe
  from the source Observable. Because the Observable is multicasting it makes
  the stream hot.
