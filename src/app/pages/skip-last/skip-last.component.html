<p>Skip a specified number of values before the completion of an observable.</p>
<p>
  All values emitted by the result of skipLast(N) will be delayed by N
  emissions, as each value is held in a buffer until enough values have been
  emitted that that the buffered value may finally be sent to the consumer.
