<p>
  Returns an Observable that mirrors the source Observable with the exception of
  an error. If the source Observable calls error, this method will emit the
  Throwable that caused the error to the ObservableInput returned from notifier.
  If that Observable calls complete or error then this method will call complete
  or error on the child subscription. Otherwise this method will resubscribe to
  the source Observable.
